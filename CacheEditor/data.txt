Proceed with caution. If you go much further north you will enter the\nwilderness. This is a very dangerous area where other players can attack you!
WARNING !!!
The further north you go the more dangerous it becomes, but there is more\ntreasure to be found.
In the wilderness an indicator at the bottom-right of the screen\nwill show the current level of danger.

The Ballad of Jareesh
Clad all in the robes for She
we travelled north expediently.
To beseech the guardians we were sent,
so to the river's source we went.
Through the cave we had to travel.
There was mystery to unravel.
We came upon a great stone door,
but our priestess knew the score.
She used the great ancestral key.
We passed through very easily.
Three great men all hewn of rock,
the three small chambers they did block.
The first all made of rock quite black,
our fighting men went to attack.
They went with Arrow, blade and spell,
but the man they could not fell.
Many men did fall that day,
while others turned and ran away.
I had little hope at all,
as I watched my kinsmen fall.
My warhammer I boldy heft
and struck a blow which while was deft,
should give scant harm to one so strong,
or so I thought, nay I was wrong.
The rock man fell down with a crash,
which sent up clouds of dust and ash.
Just myself left and alas,
two more rockmen left to pass.
Still buoyed on by my first success
onwards bravely I did press.
The next man was of rock hued  grey
and this one next I planned to slay.
Crushing blows I rained on him,
but things were looking very grim.
Not a scratch could I make.
Anon my limbs began to ache.
The rockman gave a mighty roar
so fierce I hurried for the door.
How to beat that second man,
to this day I have no plan.
My hammer never left a dent.
I never reached whence I was sent.

Five hundred years have passed since the rule of King Alvis,
saviour of Keldagrim, victim of his own inventions.
Founder of the Consortium, the gathering of mining companies
that were to serve the monarchy, eventually the monarchy came
to serve the Consortium.
By the time of his death, the monarchy was all but abolished.
By now, the Kings of Keldagrim are but a distant memory...
with only the statue of King Alvis to remind the people of the
old days.

Goblin tradition holds that\ntheir race was created by\na war-god in order to\nfight a war against other\ngods.
(They never name their\ngod, so whether it is the\nsame as any of the gods\nworshipped by the other\nraces is unknown.)
The legends also speak\nof goblins fighting\nagainst goblins during\nthe wars, so it is likely\nthat gods other than\ntheir creators used\nthem as footsoldiers.
Although goblins are still\nwarlike, it is probable\nthat in earlier ages\nthey were more\norganised than they\nare now,
especially if they were\nunder the direct\ncommand of one or\nmore gods.
This is corroborated\nby finds unearthed\nat various\narchaeological sites,\nincluding the large\nexcavation east of\nVarrock.
Armour and weapons\nhave been found,\nobviously made to fit\ngoblins but far more\nwell-made than their\ncurrent equipment.
Almost every piece of\nancient goblin equipment\nhas one of a number\nof symbols on it,\nand by correlating these\nsymbols with the\nsketchy records that\nsurvive from the\nThird Age it has been\npossible to identify\ntwelve distinct goblin tribes\nor regiments.
The separate identities of\nthe tribes have long\nsince dissolved and\nno goblins remember the\nsymbols, although their\ngenerals may still\nrecognize the ancient\ntribal names.
In the following pages\nI present a list of\nthe tribes and their\nsymbols.
A....a lemming
B....a fryingpan
C....the disenfrachaised youth of 1940's Columbia
